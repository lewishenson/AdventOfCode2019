My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

## My Progress

| Day | Puzzle 1 | Puzzle 2 |
|-----|----------|----------|
| 1   | Solved   | Solved   |
| 2   | Solved   | Solved   |
| 3   | Solved   | Solved   |

## To Run
I've chosen to solve the puzzles using C# so make sure you've got .NET Core installed and just run the Console application.

The application will prompt you to enter the day and puzzle numbers. (Note I've deliberately included no error handling!)
